            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
              The Rural Access Index (RAI) was developed by the World Bank in
              2006, and is one of the most important global development
              indicators in the transport sector. The RAI is defined as the
              “proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an
              all-season road”.
            </p>

            <p>
              The original 2006 methodology was based on household surveys. In
              2016, the World Bank partnered with the Department for International
              Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom and the Research for
              Community Access Partnership (ReCAP) to develop a new methodology.
              The 2016 World Bank methodology took advantage of geospatial
              techniques and data collected using innovative technologies, and
              was designed to be sustainable, consistent, simple, and
              operationally relevant. The RAI was adopted as UN SDG Indicator
              9.1.1. in 2016, and the World Bank is custodian of that indicator.
            </p>

            <p>
              TRL under a separate ReCAP project in 2019 has developed
              Supplemental Guidelines to the World Bank methodology providing
              additional detailed guidance for calculation of the RAI.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Supplementary Guidelines developed by TRL are available at
              <a href="http://research4cap.org/Library/Workmanetal-TRL-2019-RuralAccessIndexSupplementalGuidelines-ReCAP-GEN2033D-191219-compressed.pdf">

            </p>

            <p>
              The goal of this proof of concept application is to demonstrate
              the potential opportunities and limitations for using open
              datasets to calculate the RAI score.
            </p>

            <p>
              For three trial countries in the ReCAP programme (Nepal, Malawi,
              and Myanmar), country-specific datasets have been used that are
              regarded as more accurate than the current open datasets. These
              country-specific datasets have been used to generate RAI scores
              that should better reflect the RAI scores for those countries. The
              resulting scores can be visualised on the map.
            </p>

            <h3>
              The three datasets used in the open data approach:
            </h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=29"
                  >WorldPop</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>

                  href="https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grump-v1-urban-ext-polygons-rev01"
                  >GRUMP</a
                >
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary of the methodology:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Select commonly used tags from OpenStreetMap [Trunk, Primary,
                Secondary, Tertiary] that serve as an approximation for
                all-season roads
              </li>
              <li>Create a mask based on 2 km buffer on these roads</li>
              <li>
                Create a mask based on urban areas as defined by GRUMP urban
                extents polygons
              </li>
              <li>
                Summarise the population remaining on the 100 metre raster
                dataset from WorldPop 2019
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Known limitations on the open datasets:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                OpenStreetMap is likely to be incomplete in most countries, and
                is unlikely to match official road agency mapping unless
                specific efforts have been made by the OSM community and/or
                roads agencies to reconcile the mapping
              </li>
              <li>GRUMP urban extents mapping was last updated in 1995</li>
              <li>
                No consideration is given to land cover types or terrain in the
                2 km buffer
              </li>
            </ul>

                Surveys in March 2019.
              </li>
              <li>
                Accessibility Factors were calculated based on data provided by
                District Engineers of the Malawi Roads Authority in September 2019.
              </li>
              <li>
                Population data is based on WorldPop 2019 projections derived
                from the Malawi 2008 national census reconciled at sub-national
                level.

              <li>
                Road Network Mapping for the Strategic Road Network (SRN) was
                obtained from the Department of Roads in July 2019; blacktop and
                gravel roads in the District Core Road Network (DRCN) and Local

              <li>
                Population data is based on WorldPop 2019 projections derived
                from 2011 Nepal population census and reconciled to

              </li>
              <li>
                As an estimate of absolute numbers of people (nationally,

                nearest all-season road.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a planning tool to to help identify and prioritise areas of a
                country for rural development, linked with agricultural
                development plans, regional development plans and other
                considerations.

              For three trial countries in the ReCAP 2019 project (Nepal,
              Malawi, and Myanmar), country-specific datasets have been used
              that are regarded as more accurate than the current open datasets.
              These country-specific datasets have been used to generate scores
              that better reflect the RAI for those countries.

              The following statistics were generated using three open datasets;
              OpenStreetMap, WorldPop (2019), GRUMP. The methodology is
              described in further detail that can be found in the about
              section.

              The following statistics were generated using two approaches:
              1) with open datasets (OpenStreetMap; WorldPop, 2019; GRUMP);
              and 2) with data provided by the country using the RAI
              methodology developed by the World Bank and Supplemental
              Guidelines developed by TRL. Both approaches are described
              in further detail that can be found in the About section.
